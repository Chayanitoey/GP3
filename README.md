## Data 

**Data: Amazon Fine Food Reviews**. The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset consists of 455,000 food reviews Amazon users left up to October 2012. 

Using [KMeans](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) clustering to create a **recommendation engine.** 
Objctive: Group the right features and number of clusters when the products in each cluster "seem" like they belong together. 


#### Clustering
https://github.com/Chayanitoey/machinelearning/blob/main/final_assignment_3/K_mean.jpg
Looking from the graph ![results](https://github.com/Chayanitoey/machinelearning/blob/main/final_assignment_3/K_mean.jpg)
'55'is shown as the optimal k-mean since the point represents the best evaluation of the data set. 
The point at '55' is the most descending one based on the range of 30 to 60 clusters and Intertia. Therefore, there will be 55. clusters in total

### Results : 

![results](https://github.com/Chayanitoey/machinelearning/blob/main/final_assignment_3/assignment3_1.jpg)

- There are 20 clusters in total and based on this distribution, the min is '348' and max is '4097' - the range of the distributions is '3,749' 
- After conducting countless of trials and errors, I discovered that this # of clustering yields the most satisfying results. 

### Describe the Clusters: 
In order to describe what content the individual clusters stand for, having a description of the clusters will be benificial for further applications. To do this, the number of certain amount of samples, in this case, we'll be using 10 reviews per cluster. Those 10 reviews in each cluster will be used as an input for GPT3 itself to generate descriptions. I have decided to use the “davinci-instruct-beta-v3” model vom the OpenAI API because of its expressiveness.

The prompt assigned for GP3 is 'What is the product that the following reviews talk about?', from the review input, GP3 will generate topic or product that is most relevant and best respresentation of that cluster. 

Here are a list of products of all 50 clusters generated by GP3 :
